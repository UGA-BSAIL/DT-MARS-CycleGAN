## Prerequisites

[YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) repository for crop detection: 
```
 pip install ultralytics
```


## Getting Started
waiting for update...


## Dataset Download
The dataset has been released on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zhengkunli3969/dtmars-cyclegan). Also, you can download on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12pb47Zl1j285z5AXG8F77oASkfYqSbA0?usp=sharing).



## Pretrained models
The pre-trained models are available at [weights](weights). All the weights are YOLOv8n trained with different synthesized data.  
    - best.pt: trained with images generated from DT/MARs-CycleGAN (ours).  
    - CYC.pt: trained with  images generated from original CycleGAN.  
    - RetinaGAN.pt: trained with images generated from RetinaGAN.  
    - pure_sim.pt: trained with images generated from Publlet.
